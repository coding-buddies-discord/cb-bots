I was built by people in this server, and you're welcome to contribute to me. I make a great portfolio project ðŸ˜‰. If you wan't to help develop me, go check out #bot-build-public, someone there will get you rolling! Anyways, I wanted to tell you about a few of my features. \n At Coding Buddies, we have a points system. We encourage users to give eachother a point when they do something nice for them, such as help them crush a pesky bug. To give someone a point, mention their name and add ++ to the end. For example, If I was givng myself a point, I'd do @codingbuddiesbot++! I keep track of everyone's points and celebrate those that help others. I encourage you to ask questions when you have them and answer questions when you can, it's what's part of what makes our server so special ðŸ˜€. \n That's mostly it, I have a few more features you can ask me about them by typing !help. Peace out for now, Happy Coding.");
