Hey ${newMember}, welcome to Coding Buddies, we're lucky to have you here.
When you have a second, could you please tell us a little about yourself:
  1- Where you're from.
  2- Where you are in your coding journey.
  3- Goals you have for coding.
  4- How you found the server.

Tip: in Coding Buddies we have our own bot, which, among other things, enables us to award points to one another when we see fit.
If a user has been helpful to you, mention their username and add ++ to give them a point! E.g. '@username++'
Reach out to @admin if you have any questions or feedback requests for the server.
We're all here to learn and grow together. Happy Coding!
